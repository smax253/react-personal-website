## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deployment
Run `firebase deploy` with the firebase CLI connected to the correct firebase project. NextJS experimental deployment should handle the rest.
